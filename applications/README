This package solves both factoring and garbage can packing using consistency.
 * factoring - given a product with 2n bits, find any pair of factors that each have n bits.
 * garbage can packing - given a group of garbage cans and their items,
   choose n garbage cans that contain no items in common.

We organized the code so that the problem and solution classes are trivial and
so that the core algorithm functions are simple.
For example, the tests contain the following code.

   final FactoringProblem  factoringProblem  = new FactoringProblem(product);
   final FactoringSolution factoringSolution = factoringProblem.solve();

   final GarbageCanPackingProblem garbageCanPackingProblem = new GarbageCanPackingProblem(garbageCans, numberOfGarbageCansToSelect);
   final GarbageCanPackingSolution garbageCanPackingSolution = garbageCanPackingProblem.solve();

Garbage can packing has been tested on problems with 26 cans.
Factoring has only been tested on trivial 2-bit products.
Larger problems do not fit on our computers. We are working to overcome this limit.

Note: we always run the algorithms from the test classes.
